# Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Power BI's data analysis expressions (DAX) to generate insightful visualizations for hotel revenue and performance metrics. By employing DAX expressions within Power BI, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of key aspects such as total revenue, occupancy percentage, average daily rate (ADR), and week-over-week changes in revenue and occupancy. Through interactive dashboards and reports, stakeholders gain actionable insights into hotel operations and revenue management strategies, facilitating informed decision-making processes.
